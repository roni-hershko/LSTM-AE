# **<u>LSTM AE</u>**
## project Overview
The project involves implementing, training, and evaluating LSTM autoencoders (AEs) to reconstruct and analyze data from three datasets: synthetic signals, MNIST digit images, and S&P500 stock prices.

* Synthetic Data: Generating a synthetic dataset, training an LSTM AE to reconstruct input sequences, and experimenting with hyperparameters.
* MNIST Data: Using the LSTM AE to reconstruct images from row-by-row and pixel-by-pixel input formats, extending the model for image classification, and analyzing accuracy and reconstruction results.
* S&P500 Stock Prices: Applying the LSTM AE to reconstruct and predict stock prices and experimenting with one-step and multi-step predictions.
